# math125_calculate_grades

Runs on python3.

 To test, add data to the bb_gc.csv file (blackboard gradecenter), gs.csv file (gradescope), and restructured_webassign.csv file (webassign).

Then run the calculate_grades.py script.

The updated gradesheets will appear in the graded_files directory with
today's date in the filename.

You'll need to preserve the file structure. The calculate_grades script calls on other scripts in the repo.
